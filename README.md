# CSU_Computing_Assignment5

In this repository there are all of my solutions for the hipster coding assignments, this has been one of the fun ones. I love figuring out the logic and creating new rather than always relying on built-in functions and have even  remade a few on my own time as an exercise. I am extremely comfortable with python and I would have done the last one but ran out of time.
